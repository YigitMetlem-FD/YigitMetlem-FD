- 👋 Hi, I’m @YigitMetlem-FD
- 🚀 I joined Protons in August 2024.
- 🌍 Originally from Izmir, Turkiye, I moved to Scotland in 2010 to study Computer Games Technology at Abertay University for my own sake.
- 💻 As a full-stack developer, I transitioned from Microsoft technologies to open-source ones like Java, TypeScript, and React.
- 👨‍👦 In my personal time, I enjoy family time with my 5-year-old son, board games, and tabletop RPGs.
- 🏋️‍♂️ I also focus on exercise and diet planning.
- 📚 I like reading non-fiction.
- 🎥 I enjoy watching horror and B-movies.
- 🎸 I hope to pick up playing the electric bass again one day.
